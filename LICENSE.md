## End User License Agreement

This End User License Agreement (the “Agreement”) applies to your use of Software, SODA.AUTO’s SODA.SIM (the Software).
 Software can be used for vehicle systems and environment simulation as a part of vehicle research and development activities, prototyping, design and architecture review, testing, training, and education.

This Agreement is a legal document detailing your rights and obligations related to using SODA.AUTO’s SODA.SIM — vehicle validation system with vehicle systems and environment simulation, and any updates or upgrades of the system made available by SODA.AUTO (the “LICENSED SOFTWARE”). By downloading or using the LICENSED SOFTWARE, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be effective upon the first of those events to occur. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use the LICENSED SOFTWARE. When we say, “you,” “your” or “yourself”, we mean you as an individual or the legal entity exercising rights under this Agreement through you. When we say “SODA.AUTO,” “we” or “us,” we are referring to the SODA.AUTO entity responsible for providing the LICENSED SOFTWARE in your region detailed in Section 9.

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS A GROUP LITIGATION WAIVER PROVISION. IF YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND SODA.AUTO AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES RATHER THAN THROUGH A GROUP LITIGATION PROCESS (SEE SECTION 15). YOU HAVE A TIME-LIMITED RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS WAIVER. BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE ALSO AGREEING TO CONTRACTUAL TERMS THAT WILL LIMIT SOME OF YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, AN EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN KINDS OF DAMAGES, AND A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

*The LICENSED SOFTWARE*

1. What SODA.AUTO Is Licensing to You

The LICENSED SOFTWARE licensed to you under this Agreement includes all Software code that is copied to your computer when you install Software. This includes software code and packs of binary content.

“Software” means the Source Code (as defined below) and object code of Software, including any future versions made available to you by us under this Agreement and any object code compiled from that Source Code, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation, content embedded into software.

“Content packs” - maps and artwork, scenarios, or other content made available by us.

The LICENSED SOFTWARE includes any modified version of any of the foregoing that you make under the License.

2. How You Can Use the LICENSED SOFTWARE

SODA.AUTO grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to privately use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the LICENSED SOFTWARE in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the “License”). This means that as long as you are not violating this Agreement or applicable law, you can privately use the LICENSED SOFTWARE however you want. If you want to share the LICENSED SOFTWARE or anything you make with it, Sections 3 and 4 below address when and how you can do that.

3. How You Can Share Products You’ve Made with the LICENSED SOFTWARE

If you develop products, services, or any other projects that (i) are made using any LICENSED SOFTWARE or (ii) combine any LICENSED SOFTWARE with any other software or content (collectively “Products”), you may only Distribute those Products as expressly permitted in this Section 3. 

“Distribute” means, with respect to a Product, to provide or otherwise make a copy of the Product available publicly or to any other person or entity or make the Product’s functionality available on a network.

a.   Royalty-Free Distribution

As described in this Section 3(a), you may Distribute certain Products to certain persons or entities without any obligation to pay us royalties, until you are not monetizing that Distribution.

i.  Media Products (e.g., Rendered Video Files)

You will not owe us any royalty payments for Distributing Media Products that do not require any LICENSED SOFTWARE in source format to any person or entity.

This means, for example, you will not owe us royalties for Distributing Media:

•   rendered video files (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons, movies, or images) created using the LICENSED SOFTWARE or

•   create your own plugins, asset files and other similar products.

Please note that certain assets that we make available under a separate agreement are available for use only with Software.

ii.   Indirect Revenue

You will not owe us any royalty payments for Distributing Products to any person or entity as long as the Products are not directly involved in generating revenue -- i.e., no revenue is attributable to any Product access, including features and functionality within the Product, or to any in-Product benefits.

This means, for instance, that you will not owe any royalties for using the LICENSED SOFTWARE or Products in the research and development. However, if you use the LICENSED SOFTWARE or Products for testing automotive products that are produced and sold to end consumers, then a separate Commercial License Agreement or Individual Royalty Addendum will apply.

iii.   Other Royalty-Free Distributions

You will not owe us any royalty payments for Distributing Products:

A.   To the legal entities that are part of your company group, such as a parent company or a subsidiary, for their private use, so long as those entities do not further Distribute the Products outside of your company group.[[1\]](#_ftn1)

This means, for example, applications (which would be Products) you create for internal use within your company can also be shared with your parent company, your subsidiary, or another subsidiary of your parent company.

B.   To clients who hired you to develop the Products for them, for their private use, so long as your clients do not further Distribute the Products.[[2\]](#_ftn2) 

This means, for example, if you are hired to create an application (a Product), you can share that application with your client.

C.  To other third parties who are separately licensed by us to use the LICENSED SOFTWARE, through SODA.AUTO’s Open Source Framework.

This means, for example, you may Distribute a LICENSED SOFTWARE to end users through SODA.AUTO’s Open Source Framework.

b.  Royalty Bearing Distribution

You may make other Distributions of Products, but unless described in Section 3(a), all commercial Distributions of a Product will be subject to the terms of the separate Commercial License Agreement. Additionally, any advance royalty payment you receive to develop such a Product will be subject to the Individual Royalty Addendum.

This means, for example, that you may owe royalties to SODA.AUTO for Products that are sold to the general public or for off-the-shelf Products that you sell privately to third parties, whether directly by you or through a distributor or publisher. 

If you wish to make further commercial use of the SODA.AUTO products, please contact us to [**pro@soda.auto**](mailto:pro@soda.auto) for more information.
 

c.  Use by End Users, Publishers, and Distributors

When you Distribute a Product, you may permit end users to use, reproduce, display and publicly perform the LICENSED SOFTWARE, solely (1) as incorporated in the Product in object code as an inseparable part of the Product, (2) to the extent necessary for end users to make permitted uses of the Product, and (3) pursuant to an end user license agreement that explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the LICENSED SOFTWARE. You may not permit your end users to incorporate any LICENSED SOFTWARE into their own products, services, or other projects. You may, however, permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute a Product on your behalf, but only to the extent that you are permitted to make such Distribution yourself under this Section 3, and such Distribution will be subject to the terms of this Agreement.

4. How You Can Share the LICENSED SOFTWARE When It Isn’t Part of a Product

You may only Distribute LICENSED SOFTWARE (including as modified by you) outside of a Product as expressly permitted by this Section 4.

a.   Sharing LICENSED SOFTWARE

i.   Sharing LICENSED SOFTWARE with Another Licensee

You may Distribute LICENSED SOFTWARE (including as modified by you) in Source Code or object code to a third party who is separately licensed by us to use the same version of the LICENSED SOFTWARE that you are Distributing.

Any public Distribution of LICENSED SOFTWARE (e.g., intended generally for third parties who are separately licensed by us to use the LICENSED SOFTWARE) must take place through a fork of SODA.AUTO’s Open Source Framework (e.g., for Distributing Source Code).

ii.   Sharing LICENSED SOFTWARE for Public Discussion

You are permitted to post snippets of LICENSED SOFTWARE, up to 30 lines of code in length, online in public forums for the sole purpose of discussing the content of the snippet or Distribute such snippets in connection with supporting patches and plugins for the LICENSED SOFTWARE, so long as it is not for the purpose of enabling third parties without a license to the LICENSED SOFTWARE to use or modify any parts of LICENSED SOFTWARE or to aggregate, recombine, or reconstruct any larger portion of the LICENSED SOFTWARE.

b.   Sharing Examples

You may Distribute Examples (including as modified by you) in Source Code or object code to any third party.

c.   Sharing Non-C++ Program Language Integration

You may Distribute an integration of a programming language other than C++ for the LICENSED SOFTWARE, but if you do, the integration must be Distributed in Source Code (including, but not limited to, any compiler, linker, toolchain, and runtime), free of charge, to all third parties who are separately licensed by us to use Software, and under a license that permits licensees to Distribute the integration free of charge, on all platforms, in any Product.

5. Other Restrictions on Your Use of the LICENSED SOFTWARE

a.   Non-Compatible Licenses

You may not, and may not permit others to, combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the LICENSED SOFTWARE with any code or other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the LICENSED SOFTWARE be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement (those licenses, the “Non-Compatible Licenses”). This means, for example, that you may not combine the LICENSED SOFTWARE with code or content that is licensed under any of the following licenses: GNU General Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.

b.   General Restrictions

You must ensure that your activities with the LICENSED SOFTWARE do not:

•   violate any applicable law or regulation;

•   result in the LICENSED SOFTWARE being rented or leased;

•   misappropriate any of our other products or services;

•   support a claim by you or any third party that the LICENSED SOFTWARE infringes a patent;

•   result in a sale or grant of a security interest in any LICENSED SOFTWARE; or

•   result in a Distribution of a Product or the LICENSED SOFTWARE in any manner other than as permitted by Sections 3 and 4.

6. Who Owns What

As between you and us, you own all rights, other than rights in the LICENSED SOFTWARE, in the Products you develop under this Agreement, and we own all title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in the LICENSED SOFTWARE.

All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by the License only and not by sale, and all of those rights are limited by and subject to the terms of this Agreement. No license or other right in any SODA.AUTO technology or intellectual property rights other than the LICENSED SOFTWARE is granted under this Agreement, and no license or other rights will be created under this Agreement by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. Any attempted sublicense that is not consistent with the terms of this Agreement will be null and void.

a.  Proprietary Notices and Attribution

You agree to retain the copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of SODA.AUTO as they appear in the LICENSED SOFTWARE.

If a Product you develop under this Agreement has credits, you must place the following notices in the credits (replacing xxxx with the current year):

“© 2023 - xxxx [SODA.AUTO](https://soda.auto/) UK LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED”

No other license or right is granted under this Agreement in the trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos associated with SODA.AUTO, SODA.AUTO’s intellectual property, including Software (the “SODA.AUTO IPR"). All use of the SODA.AUTO IPR will inure to the sole benefit of SODA.AUTO. You agree not to engage in any activity that could tarnish, dilute, or affect the validity or enforceability of the SODA.AUTO IPR or cause consumer confusion or diminish any goodwill relating to any SODA.AUTO Trademarks.

If you wish to make further use of the SODA.AUTO Trademarks, please contact us to [pro@soda.auto](mailto:pro@soda.auto) for more information.

b.  Third Party Software

The LICENSED SOFTWARE incorporates and is bundled with code developed by third parties (the “Third Party Software") that may be subject to additional or alternative license terms. If Third Party Software is incorporated in the LICENSED SOFTWARE and is subject to additional license terms, those terms or other attribution requirements can be found in the installation directory for each engine version under the /Engine/Source/ThirdParty/Licenses sub­folder. Third Party Software that is only bundled with the LICENSED SOFTWARE as independent, standalone software can be found in the installation directory for each engine version under the /Engine/Extras/ThirdPartyNotUE/ sub-folder. This Third Party Software is not itself LICENSED SOFTWARE and is instead licensed to you directly by its authors under the license terms provided in the /Engine/Extras/ThirdPartyNotUE/ sub-folder.

By entering into this Agreement and using Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of those additional or alternative licenses. In the case of additional license terms, the additional license terms will take precedence over any inconsistencies with the terms of this License with regard to the Third Party Software licensed under those additional license terms. You agree that the owners of the Third Party Software are intended third party beneficiaries to this Agreement in relation to your uses of Third Party Software.

c.  Feedback and Contributions

You grant SODA.AUTO a right to freely use and disclose any feedback or suggestions that you provide to us regarding the LICENSED SOFTWARE (the “Feedback”). You acknowledge that we may use any Feedback, including any ideas contained in Feedback, for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you, including to develop, copy, publish, modify, or improve the LICENSED SOFTWARE in our sole discretion. You understand that we may treat Feedback as non-confidential.

You grant SODA.AUTO a non-exclusive, fully paid, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, make, use, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, modify and make derivative works based on, and otherwise exploit any Contributions for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country.

“Contributions” means any information or content, including software or code, that (a) you make available to SODA.AUTO via submissions to forums, wiki, SODA.AUTO’s Open Source Framework, or other source code repository under our control and that are based upon or incorporate the LICENSED SOFTWARE or (b) that you provide to SODA.AUTO and explicitly designate in writing as a Contribution.

You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback or Contribution that you provide to SODA.AUTO to grant SODA.AUTO and other affected parties the rights described above. This includes but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights. If any rights to be licensed under this Section 6(c) may not be licensed under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and agree not to assert any of those rights.



*Our Relationship*

7. The Agreement Between You and SODA.AUTO

a.  Amendments

If we make changes to this Agreement, you are not required to accept the amended Agreement, and this Agreement will continue to govern your use of any LICENSED SOFTWARE you already have access to.

However, if we make changes to this Agreement, you will not be allowed to access certain SODA.AUTO services or download the LICENSED SOFTWARE unless you have accepted the amended Agreement. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice, such as by sending an email or giving you notice when you next log into a SODA.AUTO service.

b.  Alternative and Additional Terms

With respect to your rights and obligations related to LICENSED SOFTWARE, this Agreement supersedes any prior SODA’s Software End User License Agreements. 

This Agreement, however, does not supersede, amend or otherwise affect other agreements you may have with us or any sublicensor authorized by us, other than as described in Section 7(a). For example, if we grant you a license to use Software to develop one or more products under a custom license, that custom license and not this Agreement governs your use of Software and related materials with respect to those products.

c.  Notice

Where this Agreement calls for notice from us, including written notice, we may provide notice to you through the SODA.AUTO services or by any email address that you’ve provided to us.

b.  Eligibility for This Agreement

If you are under the age of legal majority where you live or otherwise require the consent of a parent or legal guardian to enter into this Agreement under applicable law, you may use the LICENSED SOFTWARE only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who also agrees to be bound by this Agreement.

You are not eligible to enter into this Agreement and may not download or use the LICENSED SOFTWARE if you are, or are acting on behalf of any person or entity that is (i) on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or other similar lists maintained by any U.S., EU or UK government entity pursuant to economic sanctions laws or (ii) located in, organized in, or ordinarily resident in any country or territory that is subject to a U.S., EU or UK embargo, in each case unless your use of the Licensed Content is authorized by U.S., EU or UK law.

c.  SODA.AUTO Account

In order to access and download the LICENSED SOFTWARE, you must first set up an account with us, which will be governed by SODA.AUTO’s [Terms of Service](https://soda.auto/tos).

The License (as defined in Section 2) permits use of the LICENSED SOFTWARE only by individuals who have accessed it by using a valid user account (“Users”). If you are an individual, you are the User. If you are a legal entity, the individual employees or agents exercising your rights under this Agreement are Users. When exercising a legal entity’s rights under this Agreement, Users are not required to accept this Agreement as individuals. The User may store the LICENSED SOFTWARE on any of the User’s computers, but the LICENSED SOFTWARE cannot be shared with others except as part of a permitted Distribution of LICENSED SOFTWARE as described in Sections 3 and 4.



d.      Use by Educational Institutions

As an exception to the above requirement that only a User may use the LICENSED SOFTWARE, if you are an educational institution, like a school or a library, you may store LICENSED SOFTWARE on any of your computers, and you may allow all users of those computers to use the LICENSED SOFTWARE under the License on those computers. However, those users are not authorized under your License to Distribute the LICENSED SOFTWARE (including as incorporated in a Product). For that, they must obtain a License of their own.

11. Disclaimers

Nothing in this Agreement will prejudice any statutory rights that you have that may not be waived. Some countries, states, provinces or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, or the limitation of liability as stated in this and the next sections, so the below terms may not fully apply to you.

SEEKING DAMAGES AS LIMITED BY THIS SECTION 12 SHALL BE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF THE SODA.AUTO PARTIES. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF POTENTIAL DAMAGES WERE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN SETTING CONSIDERATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

13. Indemnification

This section only applies to the extent allowed by the applicable laws of your jurisdiction. If the applicable laws of your jurisdiction do not allow you to enter into the indemnification obligation below, then you assume, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws of your jurisdiction, all liabilities, damages, judgements, awards, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) that are the stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation below.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the SODA.AUTO Parties from and against all liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) arising out of or in connection with any third-party claims, demands, or actions (i) that, if true, would involve a breach by you of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any distribution or sublicensing of the LICENSED SOFTWARE in violation of this Agreement), or (ii) related to your Products or your exercise of the License (except to the extent the third party is alleging your authorized use of unmodified LICENSED SOFTWARE originally provided to you by SODA.AUTO under this Agreement infringes any patent, trademark, or copyright).

14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

Any dispute or claim by you arising out of or related to this Agreement will be governed by law of England and Wales, exclusive of its choice of law rules.

This paragraph will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits.

15. No Group Litigation

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and SODA.AUTO agree to only bring disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement in an individual capacity and will not: 

• seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class­wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions); or

• consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit another to do so without the express consent of all parties to this Agreement.
